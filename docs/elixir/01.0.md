## Elixir Basic

```shell
#! Start interactive elixir shell
iex -S mix
```

To run the :**:observer.start**, we execute the following command:

```elixir
:observer.start
```

## Start a new project

```shell
mix phx.new <projectName>
## Fetch and install dependencies? [Yn] y
## Dependencies
# We are all set! Go into your application by running:

cd <projectName>

##! Then configure your database in config/dev.exs and run:

mix ecto.create

##! Start your Phoenix app with:

mix phx.server
## ! You can also run your app inside IEx (Interactive Elixir) as:
iex -S mix phx.server
```
