# ELM Basic Programming

## Overview

**Elm** is functional domain specific language created for developing Complex Web User Interfaces. As domain language is designed primarily for developing web applications only; however, its use will eventually increase to other User Inteface types.

*Elm* language syntax was heavily inspired by *Haskell* and its main compiler is still written in this programming language. As you probably know, Haskell is a pure functional language.

## General Setup

### Perform ELM Installation

### Tools

#### Elm Repl (Command Line Tool)

#### Run Elm Development Server

```shell
$ elm reactor --port 3000
```

#### Elm Make

*elm-make* is a command line tool that does the compilation to a production version.

#### Elm Init

The **elm** init is an utility for creating an *Elm* project. This utility creates an **elm.json** file. This file describes the project. It list all the packages including core ones such as **elm/core** and **elm/html**.

```bash
$ elm init
```

#### Create ELM App

The **create-elm-app** which is very similar to create-react-app

#### Add Javascript package with Yarn file

```shell
$ yarn init -y
```

### Syntax


* *Variables*
* *Types and Data Types*

#### Variables

The *variables* at ELM do not use any specific reserved word


#### Types or Data Types

Types can be annotated at Elm,  specified at the variable declaration or they can be infered.

A type indicate a declaration of the kind of data encapsulated in a variable.

While at other programming languages, the type of a varible determines the amount of memory dedicated for storing the variable. At ELm, it indicates the kind of data stored in that variable

##### Messages

*Messages* are *types*


#### Functions

At Elm functions are first-class.
-- functioname: return -> (arg1 type -> arg2 type -> arg3 type)
Functions can be returned from other functions.
Functions can be passed as arguments into other functions.


#### Models

##### Collections

##### Tuples

* Tuples are limited to a max of 3 elements

##### Records

* *Records* have more than 3 elements

##### Dictionaries


### Examples

#### Hello World

```elm
module HelloWorld exposing (..)

import Html exposing (text)

main =
  text "Hello, World!"
```

### Add Function

```javascript
/**
*
**/
function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
```

```elm
add a b = a + b
```
In EML can also use Type Annotation such as the following example:




```javascript
// Anonymous function
var factorial = function(n) {
    // total Declaration
	var total = 1;
	for (var i=1; i<=n; i++){
	total = total * i;
	}
	return total;
}
```

```elm

```
