## Debug log

The **Debug.log** sentence allows us to debug Elm programs

### Time-travel Debugger

The [time-travel debugger](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jinjor/elm-time-travel/latest/) is inspired in a talk created . This has been removed from the elm-reactor. It has been included at the following library [time-travel debugger](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jinjor/elm-time-travel/latest/)

### Elm Make

This results on the following html

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Main</title>
</head>
<body>
<div id="elm-f0111bc4e658d0f98db96260c16f7e49"></div>
<script><!-- This includes all the elm Javascript code reactor --></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Elm make** could generate a *index.html* with the **Main.elm** file (add its dependencies). All the Javascript code included in the *script* tags is the same code automatically added by *Elm Reactor* compiled into *JavaScript*. **Elm make** could generate a javascript code in a separate file which we need to include in our index.html.

We could include our app.js file as we would do with any *JavaScript* file. We could launch this *app.js* with the following clause:

```shell
elm make HelloWorld04.elm --output=app.js
```

We could also add the time debugger option.

```shell
# Build the application with time-travel debugger
# Generate a file calle app.js
elm make src/Main.elm --output=app.js --debug
```

These commands render an **app.js** file which we could incorporate at the **html** file

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
<script>
Elm.Main.fullscreen();
</script>
```

Other option is to call the *Elm* generated JavaScript and embed it at a application container. This embeds the Elm Application into a HTML node element

```html
<body>
  <!-- Add application container div where we add our container component -->
  <div id="app-container"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
  <script>
    // Add Elm module called *Main*
    Elm.Main.embed(document.getElementById('app-container'));
  </script>
</body>
```

This same html file could be written in the following way:

```html
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Elm in the browser">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="elm.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="content"></div>
  <script>
    var el = document.getElementById('content');
    Elm.embed(Elm.App, el);
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Similar modules could be added to different part of the existing websites. It is not necessary to program everything in Elm.

*Elm* code can also be started as a worker and communicate thru ports.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello Worker</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="elm.js"></script>
        <script>
            var app = Elm.Main.worker();
            app.ports.fromElmToJS.subscribe(function(world) {
                console.log(world)
            });
            app.ports.fromJSToElm.send('hello');
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

#### Elm Make Optimization

The **Elm Make** could optimize the code through *minification* and compression. The minification allow to make the code smaller as posible removing unused code. The *minification* is activated using the *--optimize* flag.

The compression algorithm allow to shrink the code. This makes unnecessary to use specific tools for this purpose. The *minification tools* are generally added to the Build system. This makes uncessary to implement tool such as **WebPack** for performing **minification** or *compression* before deploying the code to production.

```bash
# Source Elm Main
ELM_SOURCE_FILE="src/Main.elm"

ELM_JS_FILE="app.js"

ELM_MIN_JS_FILE="app.min.js"

elm make ${ELM_SOURCE_FILE} --optimize --output=${ELM_JS_FILE}
uglifyjs ${ELM_JS_FILE} --compress 'pure_funcs="F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9",pure_getters,keep_fargs=false,unsafe_comps,unsafe' | uglifyjs --mangle --output=${ELM_MIN_JS_FILE}

```

At the *elm site*, there is a page dedicated to [Asset Size](https://guide.elm-lang.org/optimization/asset_size.html). This pages includes a more sophisticated script for using the **elm compiler** for **minification** and **compression**. We have updated this script to make it more interactive.

```shell
#!/bin/sh

##! Optimize.sh

set -e
#! Source Elm Main
$ ELM_SOURCE_FILE="src/Main.elm"
#! Normal Javascript File
$ ELM_JS_FILE="app.js"
#! Minified Javascript file
$ ELM_MIN_JS_FILE="app.min.js"

elm make --optimize --output=${ELM_JS_FILE} $@

uglifyjs ${ELM_JS_FILE} --compress 'pure_funcs="F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9",pure_getters,keep_fargs=false,unsafe_comps,unsafe' | uglifyjs --mangle --output=${ELM_MIN_JS_FILE}

echo "Compiled size:$(cat ${ELM_JS_FILE} | wc -c) bytes  (${ELM_JS_FILE})"
echo "Minified size:$(cat ${ELM_MIN_JS_FILE} | wc -c) bytes  (${ELM_MIN_JS_FILE})"
echo "Gzipped size: $(cat ${ELM_MIN_JS_FILE} | gzip -c | wc -c) bytes"
```

### Local Build Server (Elm Reactor)

There are a number of Elm Build Server. The **Elm Reactor** is a tool for prototyping the application which comes out-the-box with the Elm Installation. However, there are other options to use. The [elm-live](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live) is a flexible dev server for Elm which includes Live reload.

The [elm-live](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live) could be installed either globally for the user or it could be installed locally. The main advantage of installing it globally it could be called directly from the terminal.

Our recommendation is to use the following command with add the following options:

* **--port 3000** It sets the ports to start the server to port 3000. That way we make use we do not use a port already used for other application.
* **--ssl** It starts an *https* server instead of *http*.
* **--open** It opens the app in the default browser as soon as the server is up.
* **--start-page** It sets the custom html file to serve other than the default index.html. This is useful to open specific examples.

```shell
elm-live src/HelloWorld01.elm --port 3000 --ssl --output=app.js --open --start-page HelloWorld.html
```

Additionally, it is possible to add **elm make** flags available in **elm-live**. It just to add them at the end with the *--* in the command. Therefore, the command below shows how to turn on the debugger in the **elm make**.

```shell
# Start a hot reload session at http://localhost:3000
# Open the default browser automatically
# This command tells elm make to compile your elm code to a file named app.js 
# in the folder you are running the command from. 
elm-live src/Main.elm --port 3000 --open --pushstate -- --output=app.js --debug
```

### Elm Format

This tool provides zero-config formatting of all your Elm code. It has integrations with popular editors such as Atom or MS Visual Code. Finally, it can be used in CI using the *--validate* flag

```shell
npm i elm-format
```

### Elm Test

elm-test is your one-stop shop for testing Elm code. Useful for plain old unit tests, property-based tests using fuzz tests, as well as inspecting generated HTML using Test.Html.Query in combination with some selectors, it enables some really powerful testing scenario's.

```shell
npm i elm-test
```

The de-facto way of using elm-test is through the node-based test-runner.

The End-to-end integration testing for Elm apps and components is managed with [elm-spec](https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-spec). The

* [eeue56/elm-html-test]
* [elm-test]
* [html-test-runner]
* [elm-spec - End-to-end integration testing for Elm apps and components](https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-spec)

### Use NPM as task runner

The *NPM*

```shell
# Install locally for a Javascript project to add Elm
npm install --save-dev elm elm-live
```

```json
{
  "name": "<projectName></projectName>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
        "test": "elm-test",
        "buildTimeTravel": "elm make src/Main.elm --output=elm.js --debug",
        "analyse": "elm-analyse -s -p 3001 -o",
        "elm:install": "elm package install"
    }
}
```
